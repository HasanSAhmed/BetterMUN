Model UN Chairing Software (BetterMUN):
What is it?
Our program is an interactive software to better Model UN experience with an All In One (AIO) chairing essentials kit such as, 
a voting system and log of motions, crisis updates, timers and speakers lists, 
Dice rolls for crisis updates and the ability to open, close and pause debate as well as display working papers.
Why are we making it?
We are building this program as we are members of the Model UN club at our school and 
have noticed a lack of resources that allow for a professional setting to host a conference. 
Most chairs tend to wing it with google docs and simple timer apps. 
We want people to have a more immersive Model UN experience through a professional AIO app for chairs to display and host Model UN activities.
Who is this for?
This is for Delegates and chairs as well as Crisis managers of Model UN conferences or 
Model UN style debates. Chairs will use this software to run conferences smoothly and with ease. 
It will streamline the ability to run tasks that otherwise may be material heavy, tedious, time consuming, or uncentralized. 
Our AIO software will encompass everything an organization needs to run the motions of a professional conference better.
How will it work?
BetterMUN will work by interactively streamlining all the chairing and 
crisis essential resources into an AIO toolkit built within a dashboard.
Chairs will open the software and be able to input the conference information and 
use the functions such as a voting system and log of motions, crisis updates, 
timers and speakers lists, Dice rolls for crisis updates and the ability to open, close and pause debate as 
well as display working papers, with ease. 
Our centralized AIO will create a solution to this issue in the world of Model United Nations. 
Encompassing everything a boardroom needs to run the tasks of a professional conference, BetterMUN is here to make MUN better.
